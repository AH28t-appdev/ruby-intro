# Ruby Intro

This is the companion application to the [Minimal Introduction to the Ruby Language](https://guides.firstdraft.com/introduction-to-ruby.html). You will find a Getting Started video there.

 1. Clone this repository.
 1. Launch Terminal/Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails.
 1. `cd` into the repository you cloned.
 1. Run the `bundle install` command. This ensures you have all of the required software installed on your computer.
 1. Run the `rails server` command. This starts up your web server so that you can start visiting pages in the app. This Terminal window is now dedicated to the running web server; you can't do anything else in it.
 1. Open another Terminal tab (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) or launch another Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails and `cd` back to the same folder again. (In the GitHub Desktop App for Mac, you can also right-click on the repository name in the sidebar and select "Open in Terminal".)
 1. Run the `rails console` command. Now you can start reading the [Minimal Introduction to the Ruby Language](https://guides.firstdraft.com/introduction-to-ruby.html) and try out the Ruby that it suggests in the `rails console` at the prompt that appears.
 1. When you get to the article on writing Permanent Programs, open up the code that you cloned in Atom. The GitHub Desktop app offers a shortcut to do that on both Mac and Windows, or you can just do it from Atom.
